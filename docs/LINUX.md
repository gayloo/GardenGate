### Running GardenGate on Linux

### Keep in mind that this is currently experimental.

# Garden warfare 1
### 1. Install the game ###
* Install the game from ea app, launch it once

### 2. Download and place files to your game's root directory ###
Download and place these files to the game's root directory:

[dinput8.dll](https://github.com/nocss42/GardenGate/releases)

### 3. Install the mods ###
Use [this gw1 compatible frosty mod manager](https://github.com/Twig6943/FrostyToolsuiteGW1Linux/releases) instead of the stock one as the stock one doesn't work with wine nor gw1. Get the mods from [here](../Mods/GW1)

### 4. Configure dlloverrides & data dir env var ###
Use `GAME_DATA_DIR` environment variable as ea app won't allow special characters like `/` as launch args

```
GAME_DATA_DIR=path/to/ModData/Default WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b;winmm=n,b" %command%
```

Open up winetricks > select gw1's pfx > select winecfg > go to libraries > add the following

```
dinput8
winmm
```
